# Dynamic Subsystem Experimenting

Experimenting with ways to make a subsystem toggleable (in the sense of enabled/disabled) so that way we can use a test robot to run only the subsystems we want to test without all the errors of not having the full capibilities of the real robot (think less motor controllers, no camera, etc.)
